# Fxhash_Template_HYDRA_with_P5
Resolution to use Hydra.js within P5, thus enabling a more open way to combine the two most used visual tools in FXHASH.

To use it you need the FXHASH boilerplate, the Hydra.js and p5.js library, then just replace the HTML.js and INDEX.js (all in the same folder)

Inside the Index we have 3 parts, the first is to define the canvas we will use, one for p5 and another for Hydra.

To change the shape of your final canvas, just change the WIDTH and HEIGHT variables.

Below we will have the part for the Hydra code.

And finally the part of p5, where the canvas of Hydra is printed frame by frame in a 2D plane created inside the canvas of p5. You can use Hydra to create textures on the P5 shapes, just change the 'plane' variable to the 2d/3d shape you want.

Hope you have fun, and if you want to be kind and credit me for the template i would be grateful!
